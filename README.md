#Graph Draw 
Graph Draw is made with React. The goal is to be able to create graphs and
then run algorithms on them and see the results simultaneously for each step.

For example, you can build a matrix from a graph or run Dijkstra's algorithm and
 see what is happening.

    * [INP] Learn React JS
    * [INP] Learn SVG
    * [DONE] Get undirected graph (just static nodes and lines) data to update React
    components/SVG
    * Get +Node to drop a new node (via adding to Data.jsx) the center of
    which is where the user click after clicking +Node.
    * [DONE] Get lines logic (atan2()...) in place to automatically connect (for
    now, any) nodes. (Currently, I'm just drawing lines from the center of
    each circle.)
    * Create draggable SVG elements ()
    * Get lines to update as nodes are dragged ()
